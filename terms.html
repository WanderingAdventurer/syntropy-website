                    <li>Loss of profits, revenue, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses</li>

                <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>

                <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
                <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Syntropy, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from:</p>

                    <li>You remain liable for all obligations incurred prior to termination</li>
                    <li>Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination will survive (including provisions relating to intellectual property, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, and dispute resolution)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>15. Dispute Resolution & Governing Law</h2>
                <h3>15.1 Governing Law</h3>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

                <h3>15.2 Informal Resolution</h3>
                <p>Before initiating arbitration or legal proceedings, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@syntropy.app">legal@syntropy.app</a> to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will attempt to resolve disputes in good faith within 60 days of receiving notice.</p>

                <h3>15.3 Binding Arbitration</h3>
                <p>If informal resolution is unsuccessful, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules.</p>
                <p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator and shall take place in Delaware, United States, or another mutually agreed location. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

                <h3>15.4 Class Action Waiver</h3>
                <p><strong>YOU AND SYNTROPY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong></p>
                <p>This means you agree to waive your right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or other representative proceedings.</p>

                <h3>15.5 Exceptions</h3>
                <p>Either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect intellectual property rights or confidential information.</p>

                <h3>15.6 Opt-Out</h3>
                <p>You may opt out of the arbitration agreement within 30 days of creating your account by sending written notice to <a href="mailto:legal@syntropy.app">legal@syntropy.app</a> with the subject line "Arbitration Opt-Out" and including your name and email address.</p>

                <h2>16. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify or update these Terms at any time. When we make material changes, we will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Post the updated Terms on our website and within the application</li>
                    <li>Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms</li>
                    <li>Send you an email notification to the email address associated with your account</li>
                    <li>Provide at least 30 days' notice before material changes take effect</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of updated Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the Service and may terminate your account.</p>
                <p>For non-material changes (such as clarifications or formatting updates), we may update these Terms without advance notice.</p>

                <h2>17. General Provisions</h2>
                <h3>17.1 Entire Agreement</h3>
                <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other legal notices or agreements published by Syntropy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Syntropy regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.</p>

                <h3>17.2 Severability</h3>
                <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. The invalid provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.</p>

                <h3>17.3 Waiver</h3>
                <p>No waiver of any term or condition of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.</p>

                <h3>17.4 Assignment</h3>
                <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your account without our prior written consent. Syntropy may assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations hereunder without restriction, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</p>

                <h3>17.5 No Third-Party Beneficiaries</h3>
                <p>These Terms do not create any third-party beneficiary rights. No third party may enforce or rely on these Terms.</p>

                <h3>17.6 Force Majeure</h3>
                <p>Syntropy shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, natural disasters, labor disputes, or interruptions in telecommunications or internet services.</p>

                <h3>17.7 Export Compliance</h3>
                <p>You agree to comply with all applicable export control and trade sanctions laws and regulations. You represent that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. government embargo or designated as a "terrorist supporting" country, and that you are not on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

                <h3>17.8 English Language</h3>
                <p>These Terms are written in English. Any translations are provided for convenience only. In the event of any conflict between the English version and a translation, the English version shall control.</p>

                <h3>17.9 Electronic Communications</h3>
                <p>By using the Service, you consent to receive electronic communications from Syntropy, including emails, in-app notifications, and SMS messages (if you opt in). You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications we provide electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p>
